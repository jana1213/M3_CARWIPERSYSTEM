# Abstract
* In this project, The STM32F4xx-discovery board is used to demonstrate a car wiper control system in this project. The majority of car wipers are operated by a DC motor, but because the STM32F4xx-discovery lacks one, we're looking into using LEDs instead. Take, for instance, the wiper control system. Four LEDs and a Push Button are on the STM32F4xx-discovery board. These LEDs are orange, green, red, and blue in colour. Four user LEDs are connected to the PD12, PD13, PD14, and PD15 pins of PORTD on the Discovery board via a current limiting resistor. The GPIO pins will be set as digital input pins to make a push button function with the STM32F407VG microcontroller. The Red will appear if you press and hold the user button for two seconds. When the ignition is turned on

* A wiper is a vital component that removes rainfall or any other liquid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The previous method needed manual wiper activation, and raising the wiper was a tough task. As a result, this strategy is suggested as a solution to these problems. The project's purpose is to provide automatic transmission to older cars in order to enhance their systems. wiping system, to improve the system by adding a sensor and an actuator, and to develop a basic programme that would function seamlessly with the framework. The idea of this suggested wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers.
