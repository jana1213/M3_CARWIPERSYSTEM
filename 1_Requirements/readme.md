# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
* STM32 IDE
# COMPONENTS
* STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
# DESCRIPTION
 # STM32F407VG
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC processor, which runs at up to 168 MHz. All Arm single-precision data-processing commands and data formats are supported by the Cortex-M4 core's Floating point unit (FPU) single precision. It also has a memory protection unit (MPU) and a full set of DSP commands to improve application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are high-speed embedded processors.
# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
* Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.
* Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
* 512 bytes of OTP memory.
* Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.
# WORKING PRINCIPLE
Consider the microcontroller to be the car. When the button is pressed, the first led (red) illuminates, the wiper begins, and the second led (blue) illuminates at the appropriate pace. If you click the button again, the third led (green) will illuminate, and the wiper speed will be increased over the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange) and raise the wiper speed in line with the previous one. After the fifth click, the microcontroller (vehicle) shuts down.
# USES
# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)
# WHAT
A wiper speed control system depending on rain conditions controls the functioning speed of a car wiper. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) that monitors rain conditions in order to create. The amplitude of an analogue signal is determined by the rain circumstances measured.
# WHY
To keep the windscreen sufficiently clean to give satisfactory view consistently.
# WHEN
The windshield wipers eliminate downpour and snow from the windshield, while the headlights further develop perceivability around evening time.
# WHO
A wiper speed control framework for a car deals with the wiper's working pace because of weather patterns.
# HOW
You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
# WHERE
In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.
